Numeriqo combines number placement with arithmetic puzzles. You fill grids where each row and column contains unique numbers, while also solving math constraints within colored cages.

The rules are straightforward. Place numbers 1 through the grid size in each row and column without repeating. Each colored cage shows a math operation and target number. The numbers you place in that cage must calculate to the target using the given operation.

Grid sizes range from 3x3 to 5x5. Start small to understand the mechanics, then tackle larger grids as you improve. Every puzzle has one correct solution.

The game tracks your completion times and works on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Vision Pro. The interface adapts to both light and dark mode, staying out of your way so you can focus on solving.
